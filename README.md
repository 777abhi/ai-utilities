# Business Outcomes

## Improved Software Quality

By identifying and addressing flaky tests, the project helps in improving the overall quality of the software. Flaky tests can cause intermittent failures that are difficult to diagnose and fix. By predicting and addressing these tests, the project helps in reducing the number of false positives and false negatives in the test suite.

## Faster Delivery Pipeline

By reducing the number of flaky tests, the project helps in speeding up the software delivery pipeline. Flaky tests can cause delays in the pipeline as developers spend time diagnosing and fixing intermittent failures. By addressing these tests, the project helps in reducing the time spent on debugging and fixing issues, leading to faster delivery of software.

## Increased Developer Productivity

By automating the identification and addressing of flaky tests, the project helps in increasing developer productivity. Developers can focus on writing new features and fixing real issues instead of spending time on diagnosing and fixing flaky tests. This leads to increased productivity and faster delivery of software.

# Potential Use Cases

## Continuous Integration (CI) Pipelines

The project can be integrated into CI pipelines to automatically identify and address flaky tests. This helps in ensuring that the CI pipeline runs smoothly without intermittent failures caused by flaky tests.

## Test Suite Maintenance

The project can be used to maintain the test suite by identifying and addressing flaky tests. This helps in keeping the test suite clean and reliable, leading to more accurate test results.

## Pre-release Testing

The project can be used in pre-release testing to identify and address flaky tests before releasing the software. This helps in ensuring that the software is of high quality and free from intermittent failures caused by flaky tests.
